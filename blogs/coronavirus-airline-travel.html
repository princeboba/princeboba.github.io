              <p>The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-04-26-20-intl/index.html">coronavirus</a> is everywhere, but the disease is not something we are completely blindsided by. The COVID-19 virus appears similar in many ways to <a href="https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/">SARS</a> (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which erupted in China in 2002 and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/">MERS</a> (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome), which erupted in Saudi Arabia and South Korea in 2012.
              </p>
              <p>The impact of COVID-19 currently far exceeds the SARS outbreak with <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">over two million cases confirmed worldwide</a>. US Officials are <a href="https://time.com/5826161/anthony-fauci-covid-19-testing-capabilities/">uncertain of testing and preventative measures</a>, so how can you best protect yourself during your travels? </p>
              <div class="section-separator">
                <b>Virus Basics</b><br/>
                <p>If you’ve been following the media, you probably know that the virus has a long incubation period (between <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">one and 14 days</a>) between exposure to the virus and when the symptoms begin to appear. Even more worrying, it’s <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-incubation-period#how-does-it-spread">possible to transmit</a> the disease without showing symptoms. Transmission typically occurs through saliva or moisture from the mouth from an event such as coughing or sneezing.</p>
                <p>
                <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-live-updates-cdc-adds-symptoms-covid-19/story?id=70351472">Common symptoms</a> include shortness of breath, dry cough, fever, fatigue and muscle aches, which are very similar to having the common flu. Unlike the SARS virus, COVID-19 can start in the back of the throat and work its way down. 
                </p>
                <p>While the data is still being assessed, those over 50 years old who contract the disease have a significantly greater risk of complications and death. Preexisting conditions such as pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, as well as those with weakened immune systems are likely culprits for these findings.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="section-separator">
                <b>How do you protect yourself?</b><br/>
                <p>Travelers are allowed to wear masks <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/medical-masks">while on the plane and while waiting in line for security screening</a>. In fact, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2020/04/new-measures-introduced-for-non-medical-masks-or-face-coverings-in-the-canadian-transportation-system.html">Canada now requires travelers to wear masks</a>.</p>
                <p>Most mainline jets are equipped with HEPA filtration systems, which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207472/">should remove 99.7% of all particles</a> in the air, including biological material. Because the transmission of coronavirus is by water droplet, the area around a person with COVID-19 is more at risk than the plane at large.</p>
                <p>The transmission of coronavirus is limited to the distance you <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html">cough or sneeze</a> — which is about six to eight feet, but <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/30/coronavirus-social-distancing-mit-researcher-lydia-bourouiba-27-feet/5091526002/">could be greater</a>. This means that if you do get exposed, it’s likely because of a person seated within two rows around you. This information has been used as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/contact-investigation.html">guidance</a> for identifying individuals who are notified of exposure and may be considered for testing.</p>
                <p>If a person who has flu-like symptoms wears a mask, they’ll sneeze into the mask instead of into the air, which helps to reduce transmission in controlled environments.</p>
                <p>Health experts previously recommended that masks should be used to capture the virus by people who were contagious. The new assumption, however, is that everyone could be contagious but unaware — so wearing a mask could prevent spread and transmission.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="section-separator">
                <b>What should I know about using my mask?</b><br/>
                <p>The CDC recommends that masks be used by the general public, and seven states have now made face masks mandatory in public, including Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.</p>
                <p>All masks list their effectiveness in their description and will indicate the percentage of particulates they can block. For example, a mask listed as N95 will keep out 95% of particles, an N99 blocks 99% and so on.</p>
                <p>With the shortage of N95 masks that should only be used for medical professionals fighting on the front lines, experts recommend that the average citizen — who should be staying home and practicing social distancing — does not need one of these masks.</p>
                <p>A general patient mask will likely block moisture, but as the mask is not completely sealed, it won’t necessarily block anything incoming, so there’s still a risk of inhaling the virus. It is important that a mask is fitted professionally because if it leaks, you’re not as protected. </p>
                <p>Wash your hands before putting one on, avoid touching the mask and the elastic part and wash your hands after removing the mask. Removal is also very important: Lift with the straps, and make sure you do not touch the mask itself, as this could be contaminated. In addition, if you’re reusing the mask, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/health-fitness/how-to-clean-and-sterilize-your-homemade-face-mask/">remember to clean it before reuse</a>.</p>

                <b>How else can you stay healthy while traveling??</b><br/>
                  <p> The <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">CDC recommends</a> that you should only travel right now for urgent and essential reasons.</p>
                  <p> Wipe down your armrests, tray and anything that you will touch in flight. And ensure you’re stocked up on antiseptics and cleaning agents.</p>
                  <p>Keep your hands clean and away from your mouth. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soapy water for 20 seconds.</p>
