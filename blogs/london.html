              <p>Europe is an absolutely beautiful place to visit!
              During 2019, I had the pleasure of visiting Europe
              for the first time, touring London, Edinburgh, and
              Paris from September 18th, 2019 to September 28th (10
              days). Here are some details to get you started on
              your own trip!</p>
              <p>Before you go:</p>
              <ul class="ul-check mb-5 list-unstyled success">
                <li><b>Cell Service</b>: I am nothing without my
                phone. Make sure your phone is unlocked so that you
                may purchase a European SIM card for data service
                while abroad. There are two options:<br>
                  (1) Purchased online with Amazon - 12GB for
                $21<br>
                  (2) Using an existing provider extension (call
                your own cell phone provider for rates)</li>
                <li><b>Weather</b>: Check the weather before you
                go! When we went, the weather ranged between 45 -
                80 degrees F during our stay. It might get a bit
                rainy during various times of the year.</li>
                <li><b>Theft</b>: A lot of people get pickpocketed
                in Europe (especially Paris), so it’s recommended
                to get a money belt on you for valuables. Bring
                zippered bags and locks: People often get robbed
                (pickpocketed/mugged) multiple times within only a
                few days.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</b>:
                  The Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) is a
                  free service to allow U.S. citizens and nationals
                  travelling and living abroad to enroll their trip
                  with the nearest U.S. Embassy. <a href=
                  "https://step.state.gov/STEP/Pages/Common/Citizenship.aspx">
                  Enroll here</a> (Passport info needed)
                </li>
                <li><b>Notify your company</b>: Some companies
                require notification before leaving the country,
                even on personal travel. Check your company
                policies to ensure compliance.</li>
                <li><b>U.S. Travel Warnings</b>: Unfortunately,
                destinations sometimes have travel warnings issued
                by the State Department. If it’s a popular Western
                European destination like the ones we visited, you
                should be fine, but these are good resources.</li>
                <li><b>Print Budget Airline Tickets</b>: If you are
                flying a budget airline, many of them require
                physical, printed tickets. For example, Ryanair
                requires tickets to be purchased and printed ahead
                of time for international travelers.</li>
                <li><b>Add Tickets to Apple/Android Wallet</b>: Add
                as many digital tickets as you can on your phone to
                avoid rummaging through your email, relying on
                spotty WiFi, or messing with physical copies.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Order your Oyster Card</b>: London’s Visitor
                  Oyster Card is a convenient way for tourists to
                  travel London via “The Tube” for special
                  discounted rates. See more information <a href=
                  "https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/visitor-oyster-card">
                  here</a> .<br>
                    You must buy a Visitor Oyster card before you
                  leave home and have it delivered to you. One
                  benefit is that the pay-as-you-go fares are
                  cheaper than buying a paper single ticket or Day
                  Travelcard.

                <b>From Washington D.C. to London</b>
                <p>We flew from Washington Dulles Airport to London
                Heathrow Airport via British Airways round trip in
                standard economy class. We enjoyed the seats, which
                were roomier than domestic flights with better
                recline for the long haul. Our plane wasn’t too
                crowded and we bought our tickets at a great price,
                so we were satisfied with the flights overall. If
                you also fly British Airways, make sure to add your
                Advanced Passenger Information (Global Entry ID,
                Passport Information, Residency) in “Manage my
                Booking” on the British Airways website before your
                trip. When booking, check out this helpful <a href=

                <b>From London Heathrow Airport to Downtown
                London</b>
                <p>We took the Heathrow Express train from LHW into
                Downtown London since it seemed to be the most
                economical, “British”, and seamless way to get into
                the city. From Paddington Station in London, we
                were able to quickly call a “cabbie” (British cab
                driver) to get to our hotel easily. Ubers also
                work, but we opted for cab for the British
                experience.</p>
                <p>Details about the Heathrow Express to/from
                London Paddington Station: Train runs every 15
                minutes and takes 15 minutes to reach London. We
                paid $88.20 for 3 tickets round-trip, or
                $29.40/person, which is a discounted rate for
                purchasing ahead of time.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Tickets are available via email (PDF) or can
                  be placed on your wallet using Apple Pay</li>
                  <li>Trains run every 15 minutes from Terminals 2
                  and 3 (a few minutes more for Terminals 4 and
                  5)</li>
                  <li>Tickets are valid all-day, so there is no
                  need to book ahead of time</li>
                </ul>

                <b>Review: Ibis Blackfriars
                Hotel in London: 4/5 Stars</b>
                <p><i>September 19th (Thursday) to September 21st
                (Saturday)</i></p>
                <p>Price: We stayed at the ibis budget hotel in the
                Blackfriars neighborhood of London. In total, we
                paid $598.444 for two rooms, or $149.61 each
                between four people.</p>
                <p>Blackfriars is a lovely neighborhood and
                extremely convenient to see many of the traditional
                London sights such as the London Eye and the Tower
                Bridge. Here’s a blurb from the hotel website:
                “Right on the doorstep of some of the world's most
                famous sights and attractions, ibis London
                Blackfriars promises comfort and convenience in
                abundance. Whether you're in the capital for some
                culture on the Southbank and a ride on the Eye, or
                for a business meeting over in the City, we're
                perfectly located. Nearby you'll enjoy some of
                London's best markets, independent stores, and live
                music venues, while crowd-pleasers like St Paul's
                Cathedral and Tate Modern are within easy
                reach.”</p>
                <p>It was also very close to the District Line on
                the London Tube, which made it very convenient to
                get from place to place within the city.</p>
                <p>We found ibis to be a decent hotel at an
                affordable rate. The rooms were small, but clean.
                The bathrooms were also small, which reminded me of
                airport bathrooms (except with a shower). There
                wasn’t any toiletries except for a 3-in-1 body
                wash/shampoo/conditioner solution and some lotion,
                but I’m glad I packed a small amount of each in my
                bag. If I didn’t the neighborhood was convenient,
                so I would have been able to purchase it as well.
                The mattress was on the harder side and felt a bit
                cheap, but I did still sleep soundly. The hotel was
                very affordable, so I have no major complaints
                overall and any small discomforts were warranted
                with price.</p>

                <b>Review: Destiny Apartments in
                Edinburgh: 5/5 Stars</b>
                <p><i>September 21st (Saturday) to September 23rd
                (Monday)</i></p>
                <p>Edinburgh isn’t a huge city, so it’s not split
                into as many neighborhoods. For us, we stayed right
                in the middle of Downtown Edinburgh the old
                medieval Edinburgh Old Town and Georgian Edinburgh
                New Town. This allowed us to be in a central
                location to explore all that the city had to offer,
                from the sweeping hills, to the history, to the
                universities, to the new establishments in
                town.</p>
                <p>We chose to stay at the Destiny Apartments in
                St. Andrew’s Square, booking two rooms for $573.20
                total, $143.30 each for four people. The rooms were
                amazing for the price point, featuring large, lush
                beds and lovely furniture. The bathrooms were well
                equipped and newly remodeled - it definitely helped
                make our stay fabulous. Since this is a small hotel
                with only about 20 rooms, we felt like we were
                staying in a lovely apartment building while
                enjoying our time exploring. The entrance was right
                off the main road next to the McDonald’s, and it
                added some novelty to our trip to slip in through a
                staircase to live above the shops. There were
                plenty of stairs, but nothing that four, fit adults
                could not handle.</p>
                <p>The small downside is that the check-in process
                required a keypad, and there is no reception in
                this building. All you need to check-in is your
                flat number and your 4 digit entry code, but when
                issues arose, you would have to call the main
                office, which closed after 5 pm.</p>
                <p>Here’s an excerpt from the hotel website: <i>“St
                Andrew Square Apartments provide a great central
                base from which to explore the city. In the
                bustling East End, the property is just a 2-minute
                walk from Waverley Railway Station and places you
                on the doorstep for everything that central
                Edinburgh has to offer. An ideal base for a bit of
                retail therapy at Harvey Nichols and Multrees Walk.
                The old town and Royal Mile are a 10-minutes by
                foot, and a wide range of restaurants, bars, cafes,
                and shops are located in the immediate vicinity of
                the apartments. Great transport links to the
                airport with a tram stop 100m away on St Andrew
                Square and an Airlink bus stop on George Street
                just a few minutes walk away.”</i></p>

                <p>The Scottish Whisky Experience is a must-go for
                most tourists to Edinburgh. The Gold Tour that we
                purchased includes both the Scottish Whisky
                Experience tour and whisky tastings. I never knew
                about all the various types of Scotch and which
                regions that they are from, so it was really fun to
                learn about that on a tour that was modern with
                many technology elements. The tour guides are
                educated and enthusiastic, and the end of the tour
                allows you to venture inside the room with the
                largest unopened Scotch collection in the world!
                Even as someone who doesn’t enjoy Scotch on the
                regular, I was mesmerized by all the history behind
                the bottles in the collection. I learned on the
                tour that whisky is spelled without an “e” in
                Scotland, but with an “e” when referring to Irish
                and American “whiskies”.</p>
                <p>My friends who love drinking whisky would
                absolutely enjoyed the tour. You can even bring
                home a few bottles to share with family and
                friends.</p>

                <b>Review: Paris Airbnb in
                Marais: 5/5 Stars</b>
                <p><i>September 23rd (Monday) to September 25th
                (Wednesday)</i></p>
                <p>We wanted to spend half of our trip in hotels,
                while the other half in quaint Airbnbs. This way,
                we would be able to experience our trip in two
                different ways - one in the comfort of a hotel, but
                another with the culture and experience behind a
                unique Airbnb. For Paris, we chose Superbe
                Appartement tres bien place in the Marais
                neighborhood within the 3rd Arrondissement of
                Paris, known for shopping, eclectic artists,
                dancers, and young folk.</p>
                <p>About the Marais neighborhood: “The Marais could
                be compared to Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood, with
                something for everyone. Luxury independent designer
                boutiques contrast the plethora of vintage shopping
                that sells second-hand goods by the kilo, as well
                as haute cuisine at Zagat celebrated restaurants
                versus local corner brasseries-turned hipster
                hangouts. Unfortunately, this neighborhood is
                notoriously pricey.”</p>
                <p>There were two bedrooms and one bathroom, along
                with washer/dryer and a sofa bed. For our stay, we
                spent $528 total, or $132 each, which wasn’t bad
                for Paris. The gorgeous apartment was tucked behind
                a pair of beautiful blue doors next to shops in
                Paris. When you opened those beautiful blue doors,
                there was a peaceful courtyard, with beautiful
                French garden apartments covered in vines from a
                storybook. Every time I opened the doors to come
                home from a day of exploring Paris, I would be
                amazed by the beauty of this residence.</p>
                <p>The owner met us at the residence to provide us
                with the keys and show us around the space. We were
                very pleased to find a large, remodeled kitchen,
                beautiful furniture, Parisian architecture, and
                some treats waiting for us inside. The host
                surprised us with a bottle of French red wine,
                biscuits, and a bowl of fruit which we were happy
                to enjoy during our stay. When we opened the
                windows, we could welcome the air into the
                apartment, and people watch outside the window at
                night. We also definitely took advantage of the
                washer/dryer. Throughout our stay, he was very
                quick to respond to our messages and eager to
                provide suggestions in the neighborhood. Each of
                the rooms were even smaller than our previous
                stays, but they were still lovely and to be
                expected from such a small Parisian apartment.</p>
                <p>Plus, the location of this apartment was
                perfect. It was right next to the Republique Metro
                Station in the north of the neighborhood. There was
                a skate park right next to the metro entrance, full
                of teenagers enjoying themselves, and lively
                restaurants and music as you walk down the street.
                We loved this location so much, that I would not
                hesitate to stay here when I return to Paris in the
                future.</p>

                <b>Review: London Airbnb in
                Seven Dials/Covent Garden: 4.5/5 Stars</b>
                <p>September 25th (Wednesday) to September 28th
                (Saturday)</p>
                <p>For the last leg of the trip, we wanted to pick
                a new neighborhood in London where we would be able
                to explore something different than we had the
                first time. As a result, we chose to stay in Covent
                Garden, specially at an area called the Seven
                Dials. We booked Seven Dials, elegant Covent Garden
                - sleeps 6 on Airbnb at our priciest rate yet -
                $1117.26 total, $279.32 per person.</p>
                <p>Here’s a quick description of Covent Garden from
                another website: “Covent Garden in London's West
                End is a popular destination for visitors and
                Londoners who enjoy shopping, theatre, restaurants,
                bars, history and culture. Geographically, Covent
                Garden is located in Central London, bordered by
                the City of London and Leicester Square. It is
                within walking distance of Soho, the river Thames
                and Trafalgar Square.”</p>
                <p>We were so happy to have booked such an amazing
                location for our last few days in Europe - this
                Airbnb really blew us away. It’s located right in
                the heart of the Seven Dials, literally 3 steps
                from the actual Seven Dials circle in Covent
                Garden. For reference, Seven Dials is a unique
                section of the Covent Garden neighborhood in London
                where 7 streets intersect at a beautiful statue in
                the middle. Of course this creates a traffic
                nightmare, but it creates the most wonderful area
                to shop, dine, and explore in the city. During the
                first part of our trip, we ventured to see all of
                the big London monuments, but staying in Covent
                Garden allowed us to see the modern trendy
                neighborhoods that London is so well-known for.</p>
                <p>Our Airbnb was beautiful. It was just up the
                stairs next to a main restaurant in Seven Dials.
                After walking up the stairs, we would unlock the
                doors into the entrance and walk up a few more
                stairs into the main living area. Just like in
                Paris, we were amazed to live in a lovely garden
                apartment directly above all the popular coffee
                shops, pubs, restaurants, and stores below. The
                place itself was lovely, with two decently sized
                rooms with comfortable beds. The bathroom was new
                and remodeled, although the shower took a very long
                time to figure out how to operate. The living room
                was decently decorated, with plenty of familiar
                Ikea furniture. We did invite two friends who lived
                in London to our Airbnb to chat and hang out, and
                the living room provided a nice place to
                congregate. The place was quiet, clean, and in the
                best location possible. What really put the cherry
                on top was how we were able to explore, exercise,
                dine, and shop just minutes walking from the
                residence.</p>
