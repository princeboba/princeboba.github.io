                Belrose is a Cream Bicolor, but we like to call her a burnt marshmallow. It's one of the rarest colors of ragdolls. All of her babies will be rare colors. The boys will be flame/red, or cream bicolor, and the girls will be tortie or blue cream bicolor. She flew all the way from Florida to join us. <br/>
                Belrose is the Queen of the house. She gets along with all the pets. I have seen her sleeping with and grooming all the cats. Her favorite spot is between the back of sofa and the cushions. I suspect that it was because that's the cloest comfy spot to my desk.

                  Belrose is a very conflicted cat. As a ragdoll, she doesn't relax or "ragdoll" when she got picked up, but she is a lap cat. When I am in bed, she always purrs and finds a comfortable spot in my arms. If you put her on your lap, she will sleep and stay there forever. <br/>
                  Because of her charming personality, all my friends love Belrose. She has only been here for half a year, but I have already gotten so many request to adopt her after she retires.

                  Even though Belrose is super cute in all the photos, she is actually not photogenic. All of my friends that have met her in person said that she is so much cuter, and I didn't do a good job capturing her beauty. <br/>
                  Belrose is a very interesting. Ragdolls are known to have a period of "awkward" phrase when they are around 4-8 month old, where their bodies grow so much that their fur can't catch up. Belrose did have an "awkward" phrase. She was still fluffy but round. We were very confused how come a ragdoll's awkward phrase look like a British shorthair. But we look forward to seeing how gorgeous she is when she is full grown.
