              <p>Flights are cancelled, hotels are closed, and so
              are your dreams for a vacation this summer. Travelers
              should be wary that <a href=
              "https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html">
              travel restrictions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=

              cancellations</a>&nbsp;are likely here to stay for a
              while, as the U.S. Federal government <a href=
              "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-plan.html">
              prepares itself</a>&nbsp;for up to 18 months of
              social restrictions before a coronavirus vaccine is
              developed and tested. While the focus of many travelers has been to cancel existing plans, we are beginning to settle
              into the new norm. One of the most common questions
              that frequent travelers have begun to wonder about is
              what will become of their hard-earned miles, points
              and elite status benefits.</p>
              <p>Many airlines have been announcing updated
              policies regarding their loyalty programs in order to
              maintain their customer base and ensure that those
              customers return to start spending on flights and
              nights once they are able to travel again.</p>
              <p>Here are the most up-to-date details for extending
              points expiration, elite status, and other benefits
              like companion tickets and suite upgrades:</p>

                <img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-height:150px;"src="/images/blog/delta.svg" alt="Coronavirus" class="img-fluid"/>
                <p>On April 5, 2020, Delta <a href=
                "hhttps://news.delta.com/delta-extends-medallion-status-club-memberships-and-more-support-skymiles-members-future-travel">
                announced</a>&nbsp;that SkyMiles members would
                retain their current Medallion elite status through
                January 2022, which equates to a full additional
                year. In addition to that, the airline said that
                any Medallion Qualification Miles members earn in
                2020 and 2021 (including those that folks with
                certain Delta credit cards can accrue through
                spending) will be combined toward their Medallion
                qualification for 2022.</p>
                <p>Fliers will still have to meet the Medallion
                Qualification Dollar requirements in 2021 for the
                2022 elite year, though, which means still spending
                between $3,000-$15,000 on airfare next year. Delta
                also plans to lengthen the validity of certain
                perks like airport lounge memberships, upgrade
                certificates, travel vouchers and companion
                certificates for at least six months, depending on
                when they were originally due to end.</p>
                <p>A complete list of announced updates can be
                found below:</p>

                level of Premier elite status by an additional
                year, through the end of January 2022. This
